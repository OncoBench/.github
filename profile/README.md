# Welcome to OncoBench!

This is a repository for the curation and dissemination of datasets and algorithms in cancer research.
In collaboration with the [GHGA](https://www.ghga.de), we aim to make data sharing and benchmarking of machine learning algorithms easier for the research community.
For this purpose, we will be creating template repositories with containerised workflows for the acquisition of cancer datasets and the application of machine learning algorithms to these datasets.
These containers can, once updated with custom algorithms, be sent in for validation on hold-out datasets from the [INFORM](https://www.dkfz.de/en/inform/) and [MASTER](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.07.008) cohorts.
